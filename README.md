# Random Background Color Generator

This project is a simple and interactive **Random Background Color Generator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
With each button click, the webpage background changes to a unique random color generated through a JavaScript function.

## 🧠 How It Works
- The `RandomColor()` function creates a hex color using random values.
- JavaScript applies that color to:
  - `document.body.style.backgroundColor`
